<h1>Humanizer.Js</h1>

<p>Humanizer meets all your JavaScript needs for manipulating and displaying 
strings, dates, times, numbers and quantities. This is a port of the popular 
<a href="https://github.com/MehdiK/Humanizer">Humanizer</a> library to JavaScript. For the 
most part you can just follow the documentation for Humanizer with little to no 
issue. See below for big differences.</p>

<h2>Differences From Humanizer</h2>

<ol>
<li>Name casing has been changed for JavaScript so all functions and properties 
start with lower case now, so instead of 
<code>"Sentence casing".Transform(To.LowerCase)</code> you use 
<code>"Sentence casing".transform(Humanizer.To.LowerCase)</code>.</li>
<li>There isn't a TimeSpan equivalent in JavaScript so all action from or to 
TimeSpans now use Numbers in milliseconds instead. So instead of 
<code>TimeSpan.FromDays(16).Humanize()</code> you use <code>16.days().time()</code>. Both will 
return "2 weeks".</li>
<li>I am sadly behind the changes to Humanizer so at times what I have will be 
the old way of doing something so you might have to look at older version of 
the documentation to understand things.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Road Map</h2>

<p>I have two primary tasks currently with Humanizer.Js</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement features not implemented that are in Humanizer.</li>
<li>Update Implemented features to match updates to Humanizer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently it's just me working on this while I wait for code to compile at work. 
As such I'm only going so fast. I'm currently focusing on number 2 so that the 
documentation from Humanizer can be used. To save myself time I currently am 
only implementing default and/or English for code that is localisable. The 
ablity to add other languages is, but for the sake of getting more of the API 
done I'm only doing this.</p>
